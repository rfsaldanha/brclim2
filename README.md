# brclim2

This code repository contains {targets} workflows to generate zonal statistics of climate indicators.

The file `projects_conf.R` contains complementary information about the available workflows (for different countries) and the necessary calls to make the workflow active.

The folder `R` contains the main functions used at the workflow.

The folder `input_data` contains some necessary files for the workflows, specially reference to shapefiles conversion. Due binary size limitations on Git and GitHub, some shapefiles and all the NetCDF files are hosted outside, mainly at Zenodo. For the same reasons, the `output_data` referenced at the workflows are not present at this repository.

The other folders contains mainly the workflow status.
